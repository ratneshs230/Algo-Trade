# Rating System Updates - Change Summary

## Files Modified

### 1. File Renamed
- `rating_system.py` → `watchlist_rating_system.py`

### 2. Timeframe Weight Changes

#### Watchlist Rating System (`watchlist_rating_system.py`)
**Before:**
```python
'1minute': 0.30,    # 30%
'3minute': 0.25,    # 25%
'5minute': 0.20,    # 20%
'15minute': 0.15,   # 15%
'30minute': 0.06,   # 6%
'60minute': 0.03,   # 3%
'daily': 0.01       # 1%
```

**After:**
```python
'1minute': 0.30,    # 30%
'3minute': 0.25,    # 25%
'5minute': 0.20,    # 20%
'15minute': 0.15,   # 15%
'30minute': 0.06,   # 6%
'60minute': 0.04    # 4% (increased from 3% + 1% from removed daily)
```

#### Live Rating System (`live_rating_system.py`)
**Before:**
```python
'1minute': 0.30,    # 30%
'3minute': 0.25,    # 25%
'5minute': 0.20,    # 20%
'15minute': 0.15,   # 15%
'30minute': 0.06,   # 6%
'60minute': 0.03,   # 3%
'daily': 0.01       # 1%

Strategic weight: 0.24 (15% + 6% + 3%)
Tactical weight: 0.75 (20% + 25% + 30%)
```

**After:**
```python
'1minute': 0.30,    # 30%
'3minute': 0.25,    # 25%
'5minute': 0.20,    # 20%
'15minute': 0.15,   # 15%
'30minute': 0.06,   # 6%
'60minute': 0.04    # 4% (increased from 3% + 1% from removed daily)

Strategic weight: 0.25 (15% + 6% + 4%)
Tactical weight: 0.75 (20% + 25% + 30%)
```

### 3. Daily Timeframe Removal

#### Data Processing
- Removed daily timeframe from all data loading operations
- Updated `fetch_historical_data()` in `automated_trading_bot.py` to exclude daily interval
- Removed daily DataFrame from live rating system data structures

#### Logic Updates
- `load_historical_data()` now explicitly skips daily timeframe
- Updated data quality reporting to exclude daily candle counts
- Adjusted strategic score calculation to work with 6 timeframes instead of 7

### 4. Import Updates
- Updated `automated_trading_bot.py` to import from `watchlist_rating_system` instead of `rating_system`
- Updated documentation and comments throughout

### 5. Weight Distribution Summary

**Total Weight Distribution (Both Systems):**
- Short-term (1+3+5 min): 75%
- Medium-term (15+30 min): 21%
- Long-term (60 min): 4%
- **TOTAL: 100%** ✅

**Strategic vs Tactical (Live System):**
- Strategic Tier (60+30+15 min): 25%
- Tactical Tier (5+3+1 min): 75%
- **TOTAL: 100%** ✅

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Simplified Data Management**: No need to fetch, store, or process daily historical data
2. **Improved Focus**: More emphasis on intraday patterns suitable for day trading
3. **Better Performance**: Reduced computational load without daily calculations  
4. **Clear Separation**: Watchlist rating focuses on 6 relevant timeframes for stock selection
5. **Balanced Weights**: 60-minute timeframe gets appropriate 4% weight (3% + 1% from daily)

## Verification

All weight totals sum to 100% in both systems:
- Watchlist Rating System: 30% + 25% + 20% + 15% + 6% + 4% = 100%
- Live Rating System: 30% + 25% + 20% + 15% + 6% + 4% = 100%
